## About

J.A.R.V.I.S. is an open-source framework for building a personal AI assistant:
an LLM-powered intelligence core, a plugin/skill system, tool calling, and a
layered architecture designed to grow into voice, smart-home, and automation
capabilities.

> **Project status:** early development. **Stages 1–2** are built and working —
> an async engine, LLM integration (Anthropic / OpenAI), a skill & tool system,
> streaming, an interactive CLI, and a **memory system** (persistent history +
> semantic recall). The remaining stages (voice, integrations, automation,
> web/API) are planned. See [Development stages](#development-stages) below for
> exactly what's done and what isn't.

## What works today

- **🧠 LLM core** — provider-agnostic client for **Anthropic (Claude)** and
  **OpenAI (GPT)**, with automatic retry and fallback between providers.
- **🔧 Tool / function calling** — an agentic loop where the model can call
  tools (skills) to get things done, then answer with the results.
- **🧩 Skill / plugin system** — deterministic, zero-cost handling of common
  requests (date/time, calculator, system diagnostics) before hitting the LLM.
- **🧠 Memory** — persistent conversation history (survives restarts) plus
  semantic recall (RAG): the LLM distils **durable facts** from each turn and
  recalls the relevant ones later. Async, SQLite-backed, with similarity
  threshold + recency weighting; pluggable embeddings (offline / local / OpenAI).
- **⚡ Streaming** — token-by-token streamed replies in the CLI.
- **👥 Multi-session** — many independent conversations via a session manager.
- **📡 Event-driven** — an internal pub/sub bus with passive telemetry.
- **🖥️ Interactive CLI** — chat plus `/skills`, `/stats`, `/state`, `/reset`.

Everything above runs locally; skill/tool commands work even without an API key.

## Quick start

**Requirements:** Python 3.10+

```bash
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/nomadnairi/J.A.R.V.I.S.git
cd J.A.R.V.I.S

# Install
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate        # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure (add your API key)
cp .env.example .env            # set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY or OPENAI_API_KEY

# Run
python -m jarvis
```

Prefer `make`? `make install`, `make run`, `make test`, `make lint`.

---

## Usage

Inside the CLI:

```
Sir › calc (12.5/100)*320
J.A.R.V.I.S. › (12.5/100)*320 = 40

Sir › what time is it
J.A.R.V.I.S. › It is 14:05.

Sir › system status
J.A.R.V.I.S. › All systems nominal. …

Sir › /skills      # list skills and which are exposed as LLM tools
Sir › /stats       # session telemetry
Sir › /memory      # memory statistics
Sir › /reset       # clear conversation (keeps long-term memory)
Sir › /forget      # wipe history and long-term memory
```

Anything a skill doesn't handle is answered by the LLM (which may call tools
along the way).
